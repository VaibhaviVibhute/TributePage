            <b>A man who made us childhood awesome</b>
            <p>The legendary pioneer of Disney cartoons, Walt Disney created the beloved animated character of
            Mickey Mouse and was the mastermind behind mesmerizing animations as well as scintillating theme parks!
            Growing up in a poor family, his artistic talent was sparked by a doctor in his neighbourhood who asked him
            to draw a horse. Young Walt fell in love with drawing and painting and worked on improving his art by
            drawing cartoons from his father’s newspaper.

            He joined the Mckinsey High School as his family moved to Chicago but dropped out at the age of 16
            determined to join the army. With his relentless efforts, he somehow entered the Red Cross and then
            travelled to France with the army.

            Amidst the grim injuries and bloodshed that he witnessed daily, Walt found comfort in imagining new cartoon
            characters to fulfil his dream as an artist. Then, he came back to the city and took up a job as a
            cartoonist though soon fired with a decline in revenue given the reason that “he lacked imagination”.

            He wrote “Alice in Wonderland” while struggling with the fall of his two businesses and then shifted to
            Hollywood to sell his story. But destiny had something else for him as he went on to produce Alice in
            Wonderland under the Banner of Disney Bros. Studios and then there was no looking back as the studio reached
            new heights and established itself among the top film studios in the country as well as the world!</p></div>
